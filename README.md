# Binance DEXPLORE

Open-source free metrics, portfolio and trading statistics from Binance DEX.

Project has two main parts:

1. Binance DEX metrics & KPIs

- Asset overview - price tickers, market cap, volume
- Biggest traders and trades - track the whale moves
- Advanced filters - by trading pair, date range...

2. Binance DEX explorer on steroids

- My portfolio - track binance assets balance in BNB, USD, EUR, BTC, ETH 
- My Trades - trading history, filter by date, pair, size (5 biggest trades, last 5 trades)
- My fees - how much have I paid in trading fees? by time, pair, average fees/spread
